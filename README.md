Key Findings:
•	Best SFT configuration: Rank 4, Alpha 8, Learning Rate 2e-4
•	Best DPO configuration: Beta 0.05, Rank 4, Learning Rate 1e-6
•	Overall performance improvement: 17.6% BLEU score from best SFT model
•	All DPO models achieved identical BLEU scores but varied in training stability

2. Data Details
Supervised Fine-Tuning Dataset
•	Source: qwedsacf/grade-school-math-instructions (HuggingFace)
•	Original Size: 8,792 samples
•	Subset Used: 5,000 samples (justified by computational constraints)
•	Format: Instruction-response pairs for mathematical problem solving
Preprocessing Steps:
•	Converted to instruction format using "### Instruction:" and "### Response:" tokens
•	Applied tokenizer with max sequence length of 512 tokens
•	Used single training split (no validation split due to BLEU evaluation approach)
Preference Dataset (DPO)
•	Source: Anthropic/hh-rlhf (Human-Human Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
•	Original Size: Full dataset
•	Subset Used: 2,000 training samples, 500 test samples
•	Format: Prompt with chosen vs. rejected responses
Preprocessing Steps:
•	Parsed Human-Assistant dialogues to extract prompts and responses
•	Filtered samples with minimum response quality (>10 characters for both chosen/rejected)
•	Standardized prompt formatting for consistency with SFT format
•	Final processed dataset: 1,976 training samples, 497 evaluation samples
Dataset Selection Rationale
We selected the grade-school-math-instructions dataset for SFT due to its clear instruction-following format and mathematical reasoning requirements, which align well with our evaluation framework. For DPO, we chose Anthropic/hh-rlhf as it provides high-quality human preference data for training more helpful, harmless, and honest responses.

3.7 Output Quality Examples
Example 1: Mathematical Word Problem

Best SFT Model Response: "Liam gave 1/3*36 = 12 cookies to his classmates. So, Liam has 36-12 = 24 cookies left. Hence, each of his two friends got 24/2 = 12 cookies."
Best DPO Model Response: "The instruction asks for the number of cookies that each of Liam's two friends received. The given task requires calculating step by step: First, find how many cookies were given to classmates, then determine the remainder, and finally divide equally between two friends..."
Example 2: Open-ended Question

3.9 Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
Strengths:
•	Excellent for task-specific adaptation (mathematical reasoning)
•	Stable training process across all trials
•	Clear performance differentiation between configurations
•	Efficient parameter usage with LoRA
Weaknesses:

•	May overfit to specific dataset characteristics
•	Requires high-quality instruction datasets
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
Strengths:
•	Successful preference alignment without RLHF complexity
•	Stable training across all beta values tested
•	Improved conversational appropriateness
•	Direct optimization of human preferences
Weaknesses:
•	All models achieved identical BLEU scores, limiting differentiation
•	Requires high-quality preference datasets

•	Beta parameter critically affects training stability
Hyperparameter Impact Analysis
•	LoRA Rank: Rank 4 consistently performed best across both SFT and DPO
•	Learning Rate: Moderate rates (1e-4 to 2e-4) optimal for SFT; very low rates (1e-6) best for DPO
•	Beta (DPO): Lower values (0.05-0.1) significantly more stable than higher values (0.3)
•	Target Modules: Including both attention and FFN layers beneficial for SFT; attention-only sufficient for DPO
3.10 Common Failure Cases and Unexpected Behaviors
Observed Issues
1.	DPO BLEU Convergence: All DPO models achieved identical BLEU scores (0.0750), suggesting the mathematical evaluation task may not fully capture DPO improvements
2.	Higher Rank Underperformance: Contrary to expectations, higher LoRA ranks (16) performed worse than lower ranks (4)
3.	Learning Rate Sensitivity: DPO required significantly lower learning rates than SFT for stable training
4.	Memory Warnings: LoRA adapter loading showed warnings about unexpected keys (from SFT model weights)
Mitigation Strategies
•	Implemented gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
•	Used appropriate learning rate ranges for each training stage
•	Applied early stopping and checkpoint saving
•	Cleaned GPU memory between trials to prevent accumulation
